    "Imagine you live in a nice middle-class neighborhood. The mean income is 92,500 per year and the median income is 91,000 per year. Everybody in the neighborhood makes from 78,000 to 111,000. You would want to use the mean as your measure (you always want to if you have no reason to eliminate it). Now, consider that Bill Gates's daughter likes the neighborhood and moves in. The mean income of the neighborhood is now 4,543,000 and the median income is now 92,100 per year. The disparity between these two would cause you to question the mean as a proper measure of center due to the Gates outlier. The median would be a proper measure of center for this distribution if you were not eliminating outliers (doing a robust analysis)."
